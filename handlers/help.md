Hello, *{{username}}*!

I'm your lovely pocket for storing stickers, pictures, GIFs, voices, etc. It lets you save your favorite memes and keep
them for further use via inline mode

*Commands*

/help — prints help message
/save — starts a wizard that helps you store a meme associated with some textual alias

*Inline mode*

Just write one of your saved aliases and get the stored memes!
