*Package*

A set of aliases accessible for installation by other users via either a name or a hyperlink (don't mess up with a link to alias). By creating a package, you can share *all* of your own private *objects, associated with a list of aliases*, with other users.

To create or delete the package use the same /package command. The maximum length of the name is %d characters. The same symbols are restricted as for alias names: `%s`. I prefer and suggest you to use names in the following format: _`your-username`_`/`_`package-name`_. However, note that this name will be prefixed with your personal user identifier and the `@` sign automatically.

[Examples of packages](https://telegra.ph/Gotovye-nabory-dlya-SadFavBot-03-22) â€” mostly in Russian but there are a couple of them in English.
