*Link*

An alias that is linked to another alias. That is, you're able to make a connection between a new phrase and some already existing fav. This is an especial useful ability when you have several, let's say tens of, objects saved under the same name, and you want to associate a shortcut or completely different name with them.

To create a link, use the /link command. You can pass all necessary information in one command, if you want to: `/link shut up -> money`, where _money_ is the already existing alias for some fav, and _shut up_ is the new one.
