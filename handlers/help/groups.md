*Group and supergroup chats*

The bot may be added and used in group chats with some restrictions. The most important one is you can invoke only short forms of commands, i.e. one-liners like `/save alias` as a reply to some message.

The second one is you cannot use a chain of objects to be saved with the same alias. This is obvious, taking into account the restriction above.

The third, the only a subset of commands is supported:
{{commands}}

The bot currently ignores all non-one-line or invalid invocations. However, this may be fixed in the future to be more user-friendly.
