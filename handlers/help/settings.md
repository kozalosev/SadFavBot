*Settings*

There are some options available for the user to change.

_Language_

The language can be changed via the `/language` command. By default, the language selected at the start is used, or a system language if this step was skipped for some reason. The following languages are currently available:
— English
— Russian

The command may be used in a short way as `/lang en`.

_Search mode_

By default, the exact match search mode is used for inline queries, but it can be changed to the substring search mode via the /mode command to search by partially input alias names. However, the alternative mode may produce a lot more results if you have a huge set of favs and enter a short query.
