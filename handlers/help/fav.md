*Fav*

Fav is a favorite, i.e. an object or objects associated with some alias. The object may be of any type supported by Telegram messages:
— stickers
— images
— gifs
— voices
— music
— video
— video messages (notes)
— documents
— and even plain text (up to 4096 characters long)

In fact, the bot is a "key-value" (KV) storage. To create a fav, use the /save command, or /delete one for deletion.
