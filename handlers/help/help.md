Hello, *{{username}}*!

I'm a Telegram bot intended as a storage of your favorites, made by [SadBot](https://t.me/kozalo_blog). By me, you can create personal favorites (favs) via personal messages (PM, private chat with the bot), accessible later in any other chat by the inline mode. However, there is a way to share your favs with others by the means of the package system.

Most of my commands are implemented as a wizard that helps you to fill in all required parameters one per one. However, the last parameter may be repeated many times if you want to save or delete several objects, for example. The first parameter can be passed on the command invocation as `/save alias name`.

Click on the buttons below to get more information about the commands and my abilities. Or type the /save command to create your first fav for later usage via inline mode.
